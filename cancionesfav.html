<p>cancion1:Labios rotos
Regálame tu corazón
Déjame entrar a ese lugar
Donde nacen las flores
Donde nace el amor
Entrégame tus labios rotos
Los quiero besar, los quiero curar
Los voy a cuidar
Con todo mi amor
Es raro el amor, ah-ah-ah-ah
Es raro el amor, ah-ah-ah
Que se te aparece
Cuando menos piensas
Es raro el amor, ah-ah-ah-ah
Es raro el amor, (ah-ah-ah)
No importa la distancia
Ni el tiempo ni la edad, uh-uh-uh-uh
Moja el desierto de mi alma
Con tu mirar, con tu tierna voz
Con tu mano en mi mano
Por la eternidad
Y entrégame esos labios rotos
Los quiero besar, los quiero curar
Los voy a cuidar
Con todo mi amor
Es raro el amor, ah-ah-ah-ah
Es raro el amor, ah-ah-ah
Que se te aparece
Cuando menos piensas
Es raro el amor, ah-ah-ah-ah
Es raro el amor, ah-ah-ah
No importa la distancia
Ni el tiempo ni la edad
ah-ah-ah-ah
(Uh) ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Amor, amor
Amor, amor
Amor, amor
Amor, amor
Amor, amor
Amor, amor, amor
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

<p>cancion2:Pretty
Woah, yeah, hey, oh, yeah, aye, oo, ah
(Make it pretty make it pretty make it pretty make it pretty make it pretty)
Boy you look like a cockadoodledoo (Woah woah woah)
Here's the track
If I die tonight, imma make it look pretty
Yeah I'm in your spot, yeah I'm in your city
Actin real rude, bad attitude, actin real goofy
But if cuss you out imma make it look pretty
Yeah I'm sitting pretty but I'll leave you scarred
'Bout to pop some bottles on the fuckin boulevard
I don't need your car, yeah my Ubers large
Lip gloss shining you see it from afar
Just like Michael Jackson I'm a smooth criminal
Just like Michael Jackson I'm a moonwalking hoe
I'm hanging with the cutest crew you know how I do, Clair Clair too
We be pulling through in the nicest silks with the strongest drinks
You know what I mean, honestly just look at you then look at me
I'm feeling pretty no matter the city
We packin' knives and we out here ending lives (All day baby)
If I die tonight, imma make it look pretty
Yeah I'm in your spot, yeah I'm in your city
Actin real rude, bad attitude, actin real goofy
But if cuss you out imma make it look pretty
Get up out my face you look like a reptile
Need Bindi Irwin in case it's about to get wild
Don't follow me when you're looking like Vincent Gallo
Keep a taser in my purse, no that shits not hollow
If I beat you up, imma make it look pretty
Nails still in tact and yeah I'm still witty
If we in this thing it's about to get litty
You can have the spotlight in a little bitty (Okay okay)
If I die tonight, imma make it look pretty
Yeah I'm in your spot, yeah I'm in your city
Actin real rude, bad attitude, actin real goofy
But if cuss you out imma make it look pretty
If I start a fight, imma make it look pretty
Yeah I'm in your spot, yeah I'm in your city
Actin real rude, bad attitude, actin real goofy
But if I get kicked out imma make it look pretty
Make it make it look pretty
If I die tonight, imma make it look pretty
Yeah I'm in your spot, yeah I'm in your city
Actin real rude, bad attitude, actin real goofy
But if cuss you out imma make it look pretty
If I die tonight, imma make it look pretty
Yeah I'm in your spot, yeah I'm in your city
Actin real rude, bad attitude, actin real goofy
But if cuss you out imma make it look pretty

<p>cancion3:Blue Hair
She asked me how to be funny
But that's not something you can teach
What seemed so blue in the sunlight
By the night was a pale green
And I tried to hold her
But it didn't really last long
She's getting older
I guess she's gotta cut her blue hair off
She asked me if she was pretty
Well, it's clear that the girl's a fraud
There's really no way of winning
If in their eyes you'll always be a dumb blonde
And she cried over nothing
So there was nothing I could do to stop
Her from cutting
Her beautiful blue hair off
It looked like cotton candy
And just as quick to get licked away
Last I heard she was living
With a boy who acts his age
And I guess I'll just miss her
Even though she isn't even really gone
But things are just different
Ever since she cut her blue hair off
